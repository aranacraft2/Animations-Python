# Animations - Python
A python library that makes animations in python easier. I looking forward to updating this library.

## ¿What does it do?
¡It makes custom animations in the console for you!
## ¿How can I install it?
#### Recommended: Install it by doing ' pip install git+https://github.com/aranacraft2/Animations-Python/blob/main/animations.py ' in your command prompt
#### Other way: Download the file or copy the code into a file called 'animations.py' and put 'import animations' in the start of your main python code.
## ¿How does it work?
Like any other library! You can use 'custom functions' made by me to make cool animations like you saw in the main file.

## Version 1.0.0
### Commands/functions
> There are a lot of functions to use. You have examples in 'main.py'.
